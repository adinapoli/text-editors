## Text-editors

This repo is an exploration of various data structures suitable for text
editing, consumed via common `TextEditor` and `TextEditorAPI` interfaces.

Largely based on the original [paper](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf)
from Charles Crowley _"Data Structures for Text Sequences"_.
